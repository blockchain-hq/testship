TEMPORARY RESTRICTIVE LICENSE → MIT LICENSE TRANSITION

This software is currently under a restrictive license to protect the original
work during the Solana Cypherpunk Hackathon period.

AUTOMATIC TRANSITION TO OPEN SOURCE
On November 1, 2025 at 00:00:00 UTC, this license automatically converts to

================================================================================
WHY THIS APPROACH?
================================================================================

We believe in open source and community collaboration. This temporary
restriction exists solely to ensure fair competition during the Solana
Cypherpunk Hackathon (October 2025).

We're excited to welcome contributors and make this fully open source once
the competition concludes!

passed and files are not yet updated, the MIT License governs regardless.

EARLY TRANSITION

BlockchainHQ reserves the right to transition to MIT License earlier than
November 1, 2025 at its sole discretion, particularly if:

- The Solana Cypherpunk Hackathon concludes early
- BlockchainHQ wins or is eliminated from the competition
- Other circumstances make early open sourcing beneficial
